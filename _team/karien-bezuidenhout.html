<p>
  Karien is an advocate for openness and supporter of social
  entrepreneurs. She has played various roles within the Foundation,
  facing new challenges and learning every step of the way. She now
  focusses on the Fellowship Program - engaging with issues of
  openness and social change, identifying potential investments and
  working closely with Fellows towards realising their vision.

  She is a native of the Eastern Cape, South Africa, and the smell of
  rain after a dry spell still makes her think of home. She believes
  elephants have noble hearts and is passionate about their protection
  and conservation. It is rare for a meme to pass her by, she always
  knows what's up in the collective mind of the Internet.

  Karien studied business and economics at the business schools of the
  University of Stellenbosch and University of Cape Town.
