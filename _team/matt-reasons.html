  After a decade of supporting Canonical events and travel and gaining an insight to the world of open, Matt decided to join the Shuttleworth Foundation. He loves the idea of sharing for the greater benefit of many and is happiest when helping someone achieve a goal. Matt puts this to perfect use in supporting the Foundation team and fellows alike.

  Born to British parents in the divided city of Berlin during the 1970’s,  Matt developed a love of travel.   He now shares this passion for new foods, experiences and cultures with his wife, two children and Eddie the dog on the South Coast of the UK.
