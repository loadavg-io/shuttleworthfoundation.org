        Our founder and funder, Mark Shuttleworth, achieved great
        commercial success by building his first enterprise on
        existing free and open source software (FOSS) that was by its
        nature available for anyone to use and remix.
      </p>
      <p>
        The free and open source software (FOSS) movement has not only
        created widely used software but million dollar businesses,
        using collaborative development approaches and open
        licences. Although the model is well established for software,
        it is not the case for education, philanthropy, hardware or
        social development. The default imposed on knowledge resources
        by copyright law is automatic lock down, with ideas generated
        and owned by 'experts'. This default makes little sense if
        your agenda is social change.

        We want to understand whether, and how, applying the ethos,
        processes and licences of the free and open source software
        world to areas outside of software can add value.

      Can <a href="{% post_url 2014-01-15-thinking-openness %}">openness</a> help
      provide key building blocks for further innovation?

      Can it encourage more collaboration, or help good ideas

        Philosophically and practically, we default to open instead of
        lock down. We subscribe to the Open Definition where data or
        content is regarded as open if anyone is free to use, reuse
        and redistribute it, thereby ensuring interoperability between
        different pools of material. But for us, openness also goes
        beyond the licence. It includes being open to collaboration
        and contributions from outside our immediate reference group,
        inviting many eyeballs to review our process and make it
        better. Combining openly licensed intellectual property with
        open practices enables and encourages others to experiment in
        their own environments, localise, contextualise, translate,
        adapt and spread the tools and methodologies we are developing
        well beyond our own reach and imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        By no means do we believe that every piece of content in the
        world have to be openly licensed or every process
        collaborative. In the digital age, the lines have become more
        and more blurred between the traditional categories of
        creators and users of intellectual property. We are taking the
        stance closest to extreme openness as a counter balance to the
        prevailing idea of completely closed, in order to establish
        new norms along the continuum.
