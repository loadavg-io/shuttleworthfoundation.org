Re-imagining the internet is Anasuya's way of re-imagining the world. She is deeply passionate about and committed to this cause. She is also well versed in both collaborative knowledge creation and community engagement. Having experienced both the best and worst of attempts at expanding online representation, she is undertaking [Whose Knowledge?](http://whoseknowledge.org), an initiative to drive inclusiveness and diversity in public knowledge online.

We support Anasuya because we recognise that information and knowledge are  produced through dynamics of power and privilege: whose knowledge is  amplified, is based on whose voice is represented. This makes for a very  specific  perspective on “objective reality”. We would love to see an  increase in the diversity of online content during her fellowship. Our hope is that there will be broader acceptance of, and an eagerness to invite such contributions, by knowledge initiatives more generally over time.
