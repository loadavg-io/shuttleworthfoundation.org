Adam would like to see scientific research results benefit a far wider audience through current, accessible and replicable dissemination. He is building some of the necessary platforms, methodologies and communities to support open source collaborative knowledge production and publication as part of the academic process.

Open access journal publishing is a good start to making scientific output more accessible. We support Adam as his work goes a step further by providing an improved set of approaches and tools to record and share the research process along with the findings.
