The quality of any medical intervention is greatly affected by the availability of the tools of the trade - equipment and medicines. For both, the determinants of true access are quality, cost and relevance. For Tarek Loubani a conflict zone has forced the issue. He decided to apply his medical skills to develop high-quality, low-cost, open-source, universally accessible medical hardware to end the asymmetry of care. He started with a [$3 stethoscope](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/gaza-doctor-tarek-loubani-creates-3d-printed-stethoscopes-to-alleviate-medical-supply-shortages-10495512.html) that meets the same standards as a $300 one. Through [Glia](https://github.com/gliax), he is now expanding the pool of designs and testing them in the filed.

We support Tarek because the need is stark and immediate, he has a very specific ability to address it and openness makes a substantial difference to his cause. Rooted in utility and practicality, his approach extends beyond specific devices, to enabling independent development post-conflict and post-scarcity. This is not a challenge that will be solved in  a year. However, we believe that in this time Tarek can and will make a  substantial contribution to improved medical care today, and to how we  think about ownership of medical  equipment and devices for the future.
