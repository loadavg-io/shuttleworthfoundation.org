Gavin founded LiveSA, a media agency that amplifies the voices of the South African youth, completely created by South African youth. It started life as a print magazine in the beginning of his fellowship in 2011, but has since grown to a suite of media offerings that not only let young people make their voices heard, but prepares them for the world of work in the media industry.

LiveSA's biggest success has been in up-skilling young people through their internship programme and placing them in permanent employment.
