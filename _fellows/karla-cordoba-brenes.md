Karla Córdoba-Brenes has a vision of the world in which communities with a shared purpose can create digital currencies based on self-determined values and rules. Using blockchain technology, Karla will create an open platform allowing any group to introduce new currencies for achieving socio and environmental goals.

In a world where almost everyone is constrained by central banks, [Karla's idea](https://bespiral.com/) to spread and unify the premise of localised currencies is bold, innovative and exciting. Studies on complementary currencies have revealed many positive impacts on local environments, economies and societies. We look forward to learning from the community-driven, currency-based social experiments that will be enabled and inspired by Karla’s platform.
