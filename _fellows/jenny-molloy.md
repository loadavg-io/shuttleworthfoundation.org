Jenny Molloy is a molecular biologist and champion of open science. Her work focuses on the creation of an open and sustainable bioeconomy for the public good, where research, tools and systems are accessible to all, rather than locked behind proprietary models and closed systems. Jenny will increase participation and innovation by researchers, communities and companies from under-resourced areas, and challenge the current narrative in biotechnology that promotes profit maximisation and patent protection. 

Jenny receives full support from the Shuttleworth Foundation, and we believe [her work](http://jennymolloy.co.uk/) will prove invaluable to the future of biotechnology. This is a project with openness and social good at its core, and Jenny has a keen understanding of the challenges she needs to overcome, clear and exciting ideas on how to achieve success, and the potential to lay the groundwork for an open, more equitable bioeconomy.
