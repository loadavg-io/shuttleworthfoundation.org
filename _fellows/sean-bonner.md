Sean is working on Safecast, an environmental sensing initiative making available open, freely available local environmental data, along with the tools with which to independently measure and verify the data.

We support Sean because everyone should have access to the most reliable, up to date information about the environment in which they live, to support better decision making at all levels. Safecast enables citizens to take charge of measuring and sharing data from their own area.
