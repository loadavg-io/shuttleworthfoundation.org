Johnny West's fellowship focus was to bring openness to the extractives industries. His work establishing public understanding of relationships within the oil and mining industries included mapping corporate networks, making publicly available data searchable, building a network of financial modelers in the industry, and starting to map all of the concessions allocated or available across the world.
