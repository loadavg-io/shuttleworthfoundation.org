Adding fellows:
---------------

Current fellows should have 'current' set to 'true' in the fellow
front matter.

 - Fellow photos should be placed in /images/fellows/first-last.jpg
 - Fellow photos should be black and white
 - Fellow photos should be 300x300 pixels dimension

Alumni:
-------

All fellows (current and previous) have an entry in this folder. This
will ensure that fellow page URL's do not change when a fellow becomes
alumni and thus not break external links to these pages. For alumni
set 'current' to 'false' in the fellow front matter.
