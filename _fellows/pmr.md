Peter is a pioneer in text mining through The Content Mine, an advocacy and implementation project consisting of a community, framework and toolset which facilitate the freeing of scientific data and building of further tools for improved open Science, Technology and Medicine communication.

We support Peter because access to scientific facts across the board is vital for continued progress as a species and society.
