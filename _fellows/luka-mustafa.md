Luka is developing Koruza, a 3D printable wireless optical system for connecting buildings up to 100m apart with internet access, as a viable low-cost alternative to fiber in urban environments. The objective is to empower individuals to take last-mile connectivity in their own hands and mitigate network bottlenecks through organic growth of wireless optical networks.

We support Luka because we are interested in the process of taking off the shelf hardware, 3D printing some open components and making something new, useful and innovative. This is not new technology, it has just been either impossible to access or too expensive for the general end user to buy to date.
