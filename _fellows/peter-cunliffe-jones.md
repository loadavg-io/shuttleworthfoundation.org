Peter Cunliffe-Jones is heading up [AfricaCheck](https://africacheck.org), checking claims that public figures and institutions make against the best available public information to change the too-easy flow of disinformation, promote accuracy in public debate and kick-start a healthy skeptical reflex among the public and the media in Africa about claims that are made.

At the Shuttleworth Foundation we believe that access to information is pivotal to good decision-making and should be a basic right for everyone. The question Peter is helping us explore, is what making sense of information looks like. What is missing from the media headlines? How do we make the most of the information we, as the public, have access to - distinguish true from false, map relationships that encourage bias, or simply determine that no definitive answer exists yet. This is an essential skill for all to be effective citizens of the open web.
