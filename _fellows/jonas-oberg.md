Jonas founded Commons Machinery, an exploration of the importance of proper attribution in providing recognition and context to openly licensed resources. He built the technology needed to make it easier to openly and persistently associate the provenance of a digital work with the work itself.

Specifically, he developed the Elog.io project, an infrastructure for conveying provenance for any type of digital work, and demonstrated how this could be used with plugins within a browser environment. Most importantly, he conveyed to the community the importance of attribution and how knowing where a work comes from changes the meaning and value of it.

We invested in Jonas' work because knowing the context in which a creative work was created, is key to understanding its true meaning and cultural value. To help us maintain a link to this context, we need tools to make it effortless to do so.
