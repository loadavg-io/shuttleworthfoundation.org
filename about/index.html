        The Shuttleworth Foundation is a small social investor that
        provides funding to dynamic leaders who are at the forefront
        of social change. We look for social innovators who are
        helping to change the world for the better and could benefit
        from a social investment model with a difference. We identify
        amazing people, give them a fellowship grant, and multiply the
        money they put into their own projects by a factor of ten or
        more.
      </p>

        The Foundation is at its core an experiment in open
        philanthropy and uses alternative funding methodologies and
        collaborative ways of working to ensure that every fellow
        receives the necessary support to succeed.

        Our ideal future is one where it is much easier to find
        solutions to social challenges in a global open knowledge
        society with unhindered access to essential information and
        limitless opportunities for innovation and
        replication. Knowledge is open if it is free to use, reuse and
        redistribute without legal, social or technological
        restriction. In this sense an open knowledge society is one in
        which a superset of open data, open content, open access and
        open source is available to all.
