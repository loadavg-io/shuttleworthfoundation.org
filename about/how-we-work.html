      <h3>Values</h3>
      <p>
	The Foundation is committed to openness, integrity,
	commitment, accountability, and respect for others, and
	expects the same from all partners.
      </p>

      <h3>Open Practice</h3>
      <p>
	<a href="/open/">Openness</a> is vital for ideas to become
        stronger and spread through replication. It shortens the
        feedback cycle, enables many test implementations and creates
        opportunities beyond what we could even imagine. That is why
        we insist upon open communications, open reporting, open
        source software, open resources and open licences.
      </p>

      <h3>Open communication</h3>
      <p>
	The Foundation funds all over the world. We need regular, open
	and honest communication to; learn, be accountable, report to
	our stakeholders and ensure contractual compliance.
      </p>

      <h3>Open reporting</h3>
      <p>
	As a privately funded Purpose Trust, the Foundation is not
        legally bound to disclose its financial or impact
        reports. However, since 2004 the Foundation has demonstrated
        its commitment to speak openly and transparently about its
        workings by publishing audited financial statements, including
        reports on all investments in Fellows and their projects.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Open source software</h3>
      <p>
	The Foundation subscribes to the ethos embodied in free and
        open source software - collaboration and the freedom to use,
        adapt and share resources. We apply the free and open source
        philosophy as the underlying principle to our work. We use
        open licences to allow learning and resources to be used,
        adapted and shared widely. We give preference to the use of
        free and open source software in our own initiatives and
        require partners to do the same.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Open resources</h3>
      <p>
	The Foundation is committed to opening knowledge resources. By
        knowledge resources we mean software, designs, project
        reports, manuals, research results and other intellectual
        creations. Knowledge resources are open when they are
        available for revision, translation, improvement and sharing
        under open licences, open standards and in open formats, free
        of technical protection measures. In order to do this, all
        knowledge resources must have clear ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
	Knowledge Resources subject to or governed by copyright and
        database rights must be made open, as defined in
        the <a href="http://opendefinition.org"> Open Definition</a>:
        “A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use,
        reuse, and redistribute it - subject only, at most, to the
        requirement to attribute and/or share-alike.”
      </p>
      <p>
	Software must be licensed with a license that complies with
	the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">Open Source
	Definition</a>. Hardware is made open according to
	the <a href="http://www.oshwa.org/definition/">Open Source
	Hardware Definition</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Knowledge resource flexibilities</h3>
      <p>
	Considerations of privacy, confidentiality, security and
        utility may sometimes offer specific compelling reasons for us
        not to make certain documents or information available outside
        the Foundation and partners. Fear of unforeseeable
        consequences, of the negative reactions of others, or the
        desire to use patents to raise capital, are not compelling
        reasons to depart from our commitment to open.
