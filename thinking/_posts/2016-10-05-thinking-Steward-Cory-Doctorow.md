The September 2016 Fellowship round was the first for which we invited an Honorary Steward to make the final decision on new Fellows. We had a [brilliant experience](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2016/07/14/thinking-eating-our-own-dogfood/) with Joi Ito. He brought his individual experience and perspective. He also invested considerable time and energy in thoughtful review and reflection on the applications and their contextual environments. The result is [three new Fellows](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2016/07/13/thinking-welcome-achal-isha-ugo/) working in wildly different fields, challenging our thinking as much as the status quo, all with [openness](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2014/01/15/thinking-openness/) at heart.

We are thrilled to announce that [Cory Doctorow](http://craphound.com/) has agreed to be our next Honorary Steward, selecting Fellows for the March 2017 Fellowship round. As a journalist, science fiction writer, copyright activist and technologist, Cory brings a breadth of experience, combined into a unique perspective. We are excited to have him on board and look forward to him expanding the perspective of the fellowship. We support individuals to implement their vision for positive social change, with [openness](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2014/01/15/thinking-openness/) at the centre of their approach. We continue to look for applicants with a strong idea of the world they would like to live in and the contribution they can make towards it. Cory will help us identify which of the candidates best embrace openness and whose innovative idea has the most potential to make a difference in their chosen field.

> *"The Shuttleworth Fellows are a dynamic, effective force for good in the world. I'm honoured to succeed Joi in evaluating applications for the next cohort." -- Cory Doctorow*

<br/>
Cory's schedule allows us a bit of extra time to get to the shortlist for selection. With that in mind, we have extended the [application deadline](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/applications/) to 1 November 2016.
