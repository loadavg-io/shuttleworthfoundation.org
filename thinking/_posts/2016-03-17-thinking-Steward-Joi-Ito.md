At the heart of the Shuttleworth Foundation Fellowship Programme are two key values - openness, and supporting individuals. Inspired by the programme itself, we are evolving how we award Fellowships. Not only will we be selecting  individuals to support, we have selected an individual to help us make that decision for the coming round. We are excited to announce that [Joi Ito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Ito) will be the honorary steward of the September 2016 fellowship intake.

Joi, who comes with a rich background in openness and technology for social impact, is currently the [director](http://media.mit.edu/people/joi) of the MIT Media Lab. The individual Fellows we support carry their learnings, experiences, passions and hopes for the future with them throughout their lives. In this same way, Joi will be bringing his unique perspective to the selection process. He has a personal history of being an activist, entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and advocate of emergent democracy, privacy, and Internet freedom. He is currently exploring how radical new approaches to science and technology can transform society in substantial and positive ways. He continues to think out loud about the past, present and future of this field.

If you have an innovative idea for social change, at the intersection between technology, knowledge and learning, with openness at the core, please [apply](https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/applications/) for a Fellowship by 1 May 2016.
