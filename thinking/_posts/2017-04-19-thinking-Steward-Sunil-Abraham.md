At the Shuttleworth Foundation [we support individuals](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2015/02/23/thinking-our-experiment/) to bring about positive change in the world. Individuals carry their learnings, experiences, passions and hopes for  the future with them throughout their lives. Investing in and supporting them to work on what is broken in their world, equips them to continue to affect change far beyond the life of a specific project or organisation.

Similarly we seek out individuals who are bold and brave in re-imagining the world we live in, and invite them to bring their insights to selecting the new Shuttleworth Fellows. Sunil's experience in conceptualising, designing, implementing and convening ideas that enable the open and democratic web is an extremely valuable resource, and we look forward to him applying this lens when deciding who to include in the fellowship. 

We are searching for individuals who have a clear idea of how they can contribute to positive change. Their approach should apply [fresh thinking](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2014/02/20/thinking-application-pointers/) to a social problem, beyond the known but still needed. Most importantly they should have [openness](https://shuttleworthfoundation.org/thinking/2014/01/15/thinking-openness/) at the core of what they do and how they do it. 

Sunil Abraham is the [Executive Director](http://cis-india.org/publications-automated/cis/sunil) of Bangalore based research organisation, the [Centre for Internet and Society](http://cis-india.org/). 


*"I have admired the stewardship of the Shuttleworth Foundation towards the access to knowledge and free culture movements ever since I interviewed Mark Shuttleworth at WSIS 2005. Many of my personal heroes have become Fellows over the years and it is therefore my privilege to contribute a southern perspective to this fellowship round." -- Sunil Abraham*
