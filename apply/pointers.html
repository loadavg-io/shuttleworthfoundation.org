      Our number one ask is that openness be at the core of your idea
      and/or its implementation.

      Openness is not an add on. It is a fundamental approach to both
      participation and intellectual property. Other than that, there
      are no absolute rules, only strong suggestions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Address your application to us and customise it
	accordingly. Generic proposal material does not tell us why we
	should specifically support you.
      </li>
      <li>
	We’ve invested in OERs, education platforms and re-imagining
	peer learning before. Although this remains important in the
	world, it no longer automatically meets our criteria. We will
	need considerable evidence of innovation.
      </li>
      <li>
	“I will build a platform that will…”: Platforms do not solve
	problems. They also do not magically bring people, or problems
	and solutions, together. If you build it, there is no
	guarantee they will come. Tell us how you will do this and
	what the real world processes will be.
      </li>
      <li>
	“The Facebook for…” or “Like a social networking site for…”:
	Facebook and other social networking sites exist. They are
	theme agnostic and allow you to engage with others around any
	topic/theme/identity of your choosing. They also already have
	millions of users. Why does your theme/topic/subset of people
	need their own site? Why can’t they just use Facebook or
	similar? What will make this specific group come to your
	version? How will you let them know about it? Same goes for
	“crowdfunding platform for…”.
      </li>
      <li>
	Just adding technology to an offline process or problem will
	not solve it. Participants in the offline process will also
	not move to the technology enabled version just because it is
	there. What is the compelling reason for them to adopt the
	technology version? How will you help them do it?
      </li>
      <li>
	Building awareness or making connections is not specific
	enough. We want to support the exploration of a specific
	solution to a specific problem. Enabling others to connect in
	order to ask those questions and possibly find answers is
	great. We’re looking for more. While we think it is important
	and useful for people to come together and we in no way
	prevent this from being part of a strategy, that is not
	enough. We are looking for a specific result in change in
	behaviour.
      </li>
      <li>
	“I want to inspire (young) people…” People are inspired by
	what you do in your own life, not by what you tell them to
	do. Do not set out to inspire someone else, set out to make a
	difference in the world. Your journey may end up being
	inspirational to others, young and old.
      </li>
      <li>
	“I want to provide information on x to y…” Providing
	information only serves to inform; people need a compelling
	reason to act. Any information service has to be clear about
	the actions they will take to bring about change in behaviour
	as a result.
      </li>
      <li>
	Picture quality on your video is less important than sound
	quality. If we are distracted by trying to understand what you
	say, your message will not come across.
      </li>
      <li>
	Offline solutions are still important in the world, and often
	the best way of doing something. While we don’t rule these out
	completely, it is not our experiment in the world. We far
	prefer solutions that include an online, technology enabled
	component.
      </li>
      <li>
	“Mobile” money/payments are being done, and done well,
	already.
      </li>
      <li>
	Let us understand your context. Making it as real as possible
	allows us to understand your frustrations and see the
	applicability of your solution.
      </li>
      <li>
	“We can bridge the digital divide” and “democratize
	innovation” for “systemic change”. These are all phrases that
	are over used and mean very little. What are you actually
	doing? For what purpose? What value are you adding?
      </li>
      <li>
	Quoting others does not help your cause, unless they are
	specifically speaking about you and your project. Share your
	idea in your own words.
      </li>
      <li>
	When compiling your video, assume the viewer has not read your
	documentation. Set the scene, but ensure that you mention your
	specific idea as early as possible in the video.
      </li>
      <li>
	Focus on what you want to do next. We would like to hear about
	how far you’ve come, but this is not a history lesson. It is a
	pitch on how you are going to change history.
      </li>
      <li>
	Openness is not an add on. It is a fundamental approach to
	both participation and intellectual property. Other than that,
	there are no absolute rules, only strong suggestions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Lastly, propose what YOU want to do, not what you think we want
      to see. Of course it should be tied to our interests -
      innovation, technology, knowledge and learning – but an honest
      application from the gut lets your passion and commitment shine
      through. This is much more likely to be successful than a
      formulaic response to a call for proposals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your idea may not be for us, but if you believe in it, others will too. Good luck!
